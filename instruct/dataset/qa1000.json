Over the course of the empire, the political system became increasingly corrupt and unable to effectively manage the large population. This led to economic troubles as the government was unable to provide for its citizens. Invasions by foreign peoples, particularly the Germanic tribes, put further strain on the empire and weakened its power. Finally, the population of the empire began to exceed its capacity, leading to a severe decline in resources and living standards.

            "answer": "The history of the internet dates back to the 1960s, when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created to fund research into new technologies. This led to the creation of the ARPANET, the first packet switching network, which was the precursor to the modern internet. In the early 1970s, the ARPANET was extended to include nodes in Europe and the United Kingdom, and further expansion occurred in the 1980s as the internet protocol (IP) was introduced. In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was created, which has become the primary way people access and use the internet today."
